The Medicine Finder Project combines Python with HTML and CSS to create a web application that helps users locate medications based on various criteria. Python handles the backend logic for searching a database of medicines, while HTML and CSS provide a clean and intuitive user interface. The application allows users to input symptoms or medication names and receive relevant results, offering a seamless and visually engaging experience.
